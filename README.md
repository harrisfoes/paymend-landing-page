## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind

### What I learned

This project has given me with a lot of firsts

- I grappled with Tailwind CSS (my first project using the resource)
- Handling overflow was a challenge
- The Hamburger Menu took a full day but hoping I could now make it quicker in the future
- First time working with mobile-first design
- First time working with a figma file

### Continued development

None. This is considered done

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) - Writing in Tailwind is nigh-impossible without this
